# LB2Plus
LB2Plus provides integration between Omeka and SobekCM via an enhanced version of Lightbox2 and includes other support components.

Lightbox2 created by Lokesh Dhakar (lokeshdhakar.com, twitter.com/lokesh). Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License. https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2.

LB2Plus is based on Lightbox2 version 2.05 (2011-03-18).

SobekCM - SobekCM Digital Repository and builder - "... was developed at the George A. Smathers Library at the University of Florida by a team lead by Mark Sullivan, with ongoing effort spanning several departments." https://github.com/MarkVSullivan/SobekCM-Web-Application. http://www.sobekrepository.org/.

Our organization is currently running LB2Plus against our SobekCM instance (http://digital.lib.usf.edu/), currently at version 4.8.10b. Our Omeka 1.5.1 website is at http://exhibits.lib.usf.edu/.

LB2Plus enhancements to the original Lightbox2 and other supporting components were created by Richard R. Bernardy, Jr. @ USF Libraries/Tampa Library/Digital Initiatives & Services. rbernard@usf.edu.

LB2Plus supports linking to images, and by extension metadata, in a SobekCM instance via entry of a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in an Omeka item Identifier field to be used by the enhanced Lightbox2 plugin in an Omeka exhibit. Also provides the ability to download an image and view the metadata in the enhanced Lightbox2 interface. Works for both Omeka image items and linked SobekCM image items.

Originally created for Omeka 1.5.1 but currently testing with 2.x.

Supporting php script and xsl files need to be hosted in a separate web folder outside of the Omeka installation.
