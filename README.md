Provides ability to link to images and metadata in a SobekCM instance via entering a Digital Object Identifier in an Omeka item to be used by the enhanced Lightbox2 plugin in an Omeka exhibit. Also provides the ability to download an image and view the metadata in the enhanced Lightbox2 interface. Works for both Omeka image items and linked SobekCM image items.

Originally created for Omeka 1.5.1 but it is also being tested with 2.x.
